Hey wardens, please note that for this contest, **gas optimizations are out of scope. **The Sandclock team has gas optimizations in their pipeline, but they will not be awarding prize funds for gas-specific submissions.

Is someone from the dev team available? I've got a question


[07-Jan-22 02:39 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
I am!


[07-Jan-22 04:56 AM] naps62#6355
@danb sorry I was cleaning bot friend request, and canceled yours as well by mistake 😬 feel free to add me again if you still need to


[07-Jan-22 04:58 AM] danb#6193
thanks! DMd you


[07-Jan-22 07:32 AM] svcrypto#4603
@itsmetechjay | C4 we noticed that there are some gas optimization issues which were out of scope. which label is the best to indicate it in github findings repo?


[07-Jan-22 08:01 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
You can label those as "sponsor disputed" and leave a comment to clarify your reasoning.


[07-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
@🐺wardens please note that as @itsmetechjay | C4 shared at the outset of the contest (and as noted in the readme in the contest repo), **gas optimizations are out of scope for this contest.** 

That means there are no payouts earmarked for gas opts, so if you submit them, they will be considered invalid.

what are the advantage(s) of performing a sponsor instead of a deposit?


[09-Jan-22 11:01 PM] Pedroais#1630
Hi devs could you please explain what are shares supposed to represent ? What's the relation between total shares and total principal ? Thanks


[09-Jan-22 11:41 PM] Pedroais#1630
Also how should withdraws work for invested funds? If I have funds in the vault that are invested in a strategy how can I take them out ?


[10-Jan-22 01:23 AM] hickuphh3#4268
1 or more deposit NFTs (dependent on no. of claimers u allocated) are minted whenever u call `deposit()`. Burn these NFTs to receive the principal amount.


[10-Jan-22 05:09 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
the sponsor is when you want to boot the yield for everyone in the vault, the deposit is when you want to give the yield to a specific account


[10-Jan-22 05:10 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
It's tricky, the shares represent everything but the sponsor deposits, the total principal is the sum of the deposits (except sponsors)


[10-Jan-22 05:13 AM] Kenzo Agada | AFK for a while#5926
Did you develop the shares math/mechanism? Or did you borrow it from some other protocol / there's a description of it somewhere? It's pretty cool


[10-Jan-22 05:19 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
It's based on other protocols with a few tweaks for our use case. I think these are called elastic shares? We just changed it so the shares kind of move from the depositor to the claimer as they gain value

Yeah, I get it from a technical perspective, but not from a business / financial one. What benefit / incentive do I get from being a sponsor? Why would I want to boost the yield of everyone else's and not my own?


[10-Jan-22 07:16 AM] Pedroais#1630
Sorry I still don't get it. What's the difference between shares and totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored ?


[10-Jan-22 07:18 AM] Pedroais#1630
What I meant is what happens if I want to withdraw funds that are currently invested inside the strategy. The withdraw function will only give me funds in the vault contract right ? What about the funds inside the strategy or even invested funds in eth-ancor ?


[10-Jan-22 07:20 AM] Kenzo Agada | AFK for a while#5926
The protocol uses the shares to calculate how much of totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored should go to each depositor/claimer


[10-Jan-22 07:25 AM] Pedroais#1630
So myshares/totalshares is the fraction of totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored  I own  ?


[10-Jan-22 07:26 AM] Pedroais#1630
If i have 5 shares and total shares = 15 I own a third of the vault funds - sponsors ?


[10-Jan-22 07:37 AM] hickuphh3#4268
ahhh right, got what u mean. am wondering too... 🧐

is it even possible that depositShares > claimerShares? shares value only increases

@naps62


[10-Jan-22 09:20 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
None, at the moment, the only organization that could be a sponsor is sandclock itself


[10-Jan-22 09:21 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
the shares represent that totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored. Owning a shares means owning a piece of totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored


[10-Jan-22 09:23 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
We are still not 100% sure what the mechanics will be, but we'll keep around a percentage of the total underlying in the vault for withdraws. So you don't take money from the strategy, you always take it from the vault. We'll then rebalance the strategy to make sure enough funds are in the vault.


[10-Jan-22 09:24 AM] gabrielpoca#1685
The shares's value can decrease if the strategy is losing money
